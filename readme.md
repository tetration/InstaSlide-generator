#InstaSlide

###Description: 

**InstaSlide** is a Python script that generates a series of images for Instagram that contain programming tips and tricks. The script reads input from a JSON file that includes the title, tip, website, Instagram username, and the path to the user's rounded profile picture. The script generates an image for each tip that is optimized for Instagram's slideshow format.

The user can easily customize the JSON file to include their own tips and profile picture, making it a perfect tool for developers who want to share their knowledge on Instagram. The script uses the Pillow library to generate the images, and it includes error handling to ensure that all parameters are present and valid.
