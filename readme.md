# InstaSlide

### Description: 

**InstaSlide** is a Python script that generates a series of images for Instagram that contain programming tips and tricks. The script reads input from a JSON file that includes the title, tip, website, Instagram username, and the path to the user's rounded profile picture. The script generates an image for each tip that is optimized for Instagram's slideshow format.

The user can easily customize the JSON file to include their own tips and profile picture, making it a perfect tool for developers and any kind of content creator who want to share their knowledge on Instagram. The script uses the Pillow library to generate the images, and it includes error handling to ensure that all parameters are present and valid.


### Configuring your python environment to run InstaSlide
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will generate a requirements.txt file in the current directory containing the names of all the installed packages and their versions. You can edit this file as needed, removing or adding specific packages and their respective versions. Once you're done, you can use this file to install all the necessary packages on another machine by running the following command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Make sure you run this command in the same directory that your requirements.txt file is located.**
